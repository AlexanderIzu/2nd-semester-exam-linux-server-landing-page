# Landing Page in the Cloud: A Hands-On Guide to AWS EC2 and Linux Server Deployment üêß‚òÅÔ∏è

Hello and welcome to my Linux-powered landing page project, deployed on an EC2 instance in AWS. In this project, I had the opportunity to dive into provisioning a cloud server, setting up a web server, and deploying a simple landing page to showcase my skills. Let me walk you through how I brought it all together.
## Check Out the Web Page

Before we dive into the details, want to see it live? Click below to check out my deployed landing page:

**Secure HTTPS URL**: [https://web.izuchukwu.mooo.com](https://web.izuchukwu.mooo.com)

**Public IP Address**: [18.214.150.124](http://18.214.150.124/)

**Note**:
- *When accessing websites, always prefer using the HTTPS version for a more secure experience. It encrypts your connection, ensuring your data remains safe while browsing.* 
- *The server is temporary and may be taken down shortly. If the instance is stopped, the server will be unavailable, and the links above may not work until the instance is restarted.*
- *If the instance is **terminated**, the IP address associated to this url will no longer be available.*

### üõ†Ô∏è How I Built It
**Step 1:** Provisioning the Server 

I started by provisioning an EC2 instance on AWS. I went with the Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS AMI, selected the t2.micro instance type (free-tier eligible), and set up a Key Pair for secure SSH access.

**Steps Taken:**

- Logged into the AWS Management Console, searched for and accessed EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).
- Created a new EC2 instance using the Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS AMI.
- Selected t2.micro as the instance type (free for 750 hrs per month and suitable for small workloads)
- Configured a Key Pair for SSH access and saved the .pem file.
- Allowed HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22), and HTTPS (port 443) traffic in the Security Group.
- Launched the instance and connected via SSH on a CLI (Git Bash):

```bash
ssh -i "Alexkey.pem" ubuntu@my-public-ip
```
**Step 2: Installing Apache** 

To serve my page, I needed a web server. I installed Apache on the server and made sure it started automatically whenever the server booted up.

**Steps Taken:**

- Updated the server packages with the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- Installed Apache:
```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```
- Started and enabled Apache to run on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```
- Verified everything was working by visiting the public IP in a browser.

**Note**: 
*I have attached an Elastic IP to the EC2 instance. The public IP shown in the image is not accessible, as Elastic IPs carry a different IP address.*

### Step 3: Deploying the Landing Page üíª

Next, I deployed the index.html landing page. I created this file in the server‚Äôs root directory and added a little introduction about me and a brief description of this project.

**Steps Taken:**

- Navigated to the web server‚Äôs root directory:
```bash
cd /var/www/html
```
- Created the index.html file:
```bash
sudo nano index.html
```
- Added the following HTML content: (Snapshot below)

- Adjusted permissions to ensure Apache could serve the file using the command:
```bash
sudo chmod 644 index.html
```
**Step 4: Configuring Networking** üåç

I needed to make sure the world could access my landing page, so I updated the Security Group to allow HTTP (port 80) traffic on the AWS Management Console. Then, I tested it by visiting the public IP in a browser.

**Steps Taken:**

- Edited the Security Group of my EC2 instance to allow HTTP traffic from anywhere.
- Tested by accessing the page via the public IP: [http://web.izuchukwu.mooo.com](https://web.izuchukwu.mooo.com)

### Bonus Step: Setting Up HTTPS üîí

For extra security, I set up HTTPS using Let‚Äôs Encrypt. This ensures visitors can access the page over a secure connection. I got a subdomain on a free DNS hosting provider (https://freedns.afraid.org) to complete this process.

**Steps Taken:**

- Installed Certbot for Apache:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
```
- Configured HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt:
```bash
sudo certbot --apache
```
